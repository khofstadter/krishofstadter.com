## log
- 2023-06-26 realized after running, that I should start writing publicly instead of in my notebooks only. Maybe having Journeys Around The Secret Place published is the new beginning which brought momentum. I simplified the page and plan to gradually add to it. 
- 2023-02-21 add dark/light button to the navigation based on info at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp. Also added a new font with Google Fonts and then used 'auto indent code' to make the file more human-readable. 
- 2023-03-17 inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/, I set up the HTML core of index page
