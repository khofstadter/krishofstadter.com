    <p>Hey there! I’m a Hungarian interdisciplinary researcher living in England. While my main focus is on using sound to induce and maintain altered states of consciousness, I am interested in many other things too e.g. in developing my personal knowledge management and keeping myself and my family healthy.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>I work on the Enhancing Audio Description II project as a postdoc at the University of York, teach the Navigating the Digital World module as a part-time lecturer at the University of Essex and develop chapter of doctoral thesis into research papers for relevant journals as an independent researcher. In am also personalizing the zettlekasten method in Visual Studio Code using Foam and redesigning my old website to better archive my work. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Some Past Works</h2>
    <p> Most of my music can be found on Bandcamp, some videos on YouTube and a recent academic CV here.</p>
